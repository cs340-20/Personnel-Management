XAMPP HOSTING:  

  Xampp hosting will allow us to run our page and database on a local host. 
  Download Xampp and use the file structure below to setup the webpage directory.
  Download link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
  Once you set up your file structure below, start Xampp and activate Apache and MySQL. 
  localhost/index.php will get you to the homepage.


FILE STRUCTURE: 

  PM-css, PM-extras, PM-pages, and index.php should be placed into the htdocs folder in your xampp directory for live hosting
  PM-css contains all css files for the web application
  PM-pages contains all webpage files (html, php)
  PM-extras contains all object files (php function definitions and other reusable blocks)
  
  
Editor: 

  I'll be using the Visual Studio Code editor to work on the project. It's got lots of cool tools and auto-fill capabilities
