### Introduction
AdminMax is a personnel management service. We have been a part of organizations and teams in the past that waste 
time on administrative tasks due to the use of fragmented and clunky services. Our project is intended to fill that 
void in the market and serve as a single, comprehensive personnel management service. There were no major changes to requirements, design, and development plans in our project's life cycle. We met most of our project goals on the front-end, but we fell short in our plans for backend development.

### Customer Value
  No changes
  
### Technology 

   #### Front End
  The front end structure of AdminMax is structured with standard HTML and CSS
    
   #### Back End
  The Back end functionality for AdminMax is driven by a combination of PHP and Javascript. We leveraged PHP script to create
  iterative, dynamic webpage functionalty. PHP gave us the ability to create dynamic HTML tables based on our stored databases 
  and user permissions. 
    
   #### Database
  The database framework utilized by AdminMax is MySQL. MySQL allowed us to create tables to represent our user base, 
  sub-organizations, events, and attendance data. This database and query language provided us the opportunity to effectively
  provide our users with an easy to use, flexible administrative interface

### Team

### Project management

### Reflection 
Our planning process went well. We always had a well defined end result for the features that were planned. In the development phase, we ran into problems trying to actually implement the features using the technology that we chose. We learned the value of flexibility in development and were able to pivot to using different tools and methods of development when needed. As far as team management, we found it best to rotate the project manager regularly. The most important lesson learned was the necessity of communication in a development team. Each member must be on the same page and have a high level of awareness for the project to run smoothly and be successful. 

Even though we did not meet all of our project goals, I believe that the final project was a success because we achieved a base functionality, and more importantly, we learned a great deal about modern development practices and teamwork in the context of software engineering.
