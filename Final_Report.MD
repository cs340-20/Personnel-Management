### Introduction
AdminMax is a personnel management service. We have been a part of organizations and teams in the past that waste 
time on administrative tasks due to the use of fragmented and clunky services. Our project is intended to fill that 
void in the market and serve as a single, comprehensive personnel management service. There were no major changes to 
requirements, design, and development plans in our project's life cycle. We met most of our project goals on the front-end
and surpassed our minimum viable system for the backend, but we fell short in our smaller, optional plans for backend 
development.

Overall, we are satisfied with the current quality of AdminMax. Some changes would be necessary in the shift to a live host,
specifically for the Google Login Authentication and backend messaging services, but as of now, AdminMax is functional and 
achieves the goals we set for it.

### Customer Value
  No changes
  
### Technology 

   #### Front End
  The front end structure of AdminMax is structured with standard HTML and CSS. Some components also utilize Javascript to
  improve user experience. Specifically, many of the animated elements within the webpage were a combination of both javascript
  and CSS. These made AdminMax feel less like a "project" and more like an every-day webservice that people would use.
    
   #### Back End
  The Back end functionality for AdminMax is driven by a combination of PHP and Javascript. We leveraged PHP script to create
  iterative, dynamic webpage functionalty. PHP gave us the ability to create dynamic HTML tables based on our stored databases 
  and user permissions. PHP was also used to interface with our MySQL database and to perform queries that gave us the desired
  information when interfacing with the user and performing back end queries
    
   #### Database
  The database framework utilized by AdminMax is MySQL. MySQL allowed us to create tables to represent our user base, 
  sub-organizations, events, and attendance data. This database and query language provided us the opportunity to effectively
  provide our users with an easy to use, flexible administrative interface. This language, paired with PHPMyAdmin through the 
  local host service, gave us a developer interface to easily manage our database without having our completed webservice
  running. All in all, PHPMyAdmin allowed us to construct our database and define the structure that our backend functionality
  required via a ready to use interface

### Team
Everyone on this team contibuted to the project in different ways. We did not have specific roles, however Cainan and Alex were
the main initiators in terms of work spread. This project was oriented to help with ROTC functionalities therefore Alex and 
Cainan shifted the work load to contibrute to that result. The roles in terms of the semester have been static. 

### Project management
In the early stages of development, the project was divided into stages based on certain core features that we wanted to implement. Each member took on the implementation of one of these core features. Once these few main features were implemented, the management structure took on a more loose form in which smaller features and bug fixes were handled on the fly in an ad hoc fashion.

### Reflection 
Our planning process went well. We always had a well defined end result for the features that were planned. In the development 
phase, we ran into problems trying to actually implement the features using the technology that we chose. We learned the value 
of flexibility in development and were able to pivot to using different tools and methods of development when needed. As far as 
team management, we found it best to rotate the project manager regularly. The most important lesson learned was the necessity 
of communication in a development team. Each member must be on the same page and have a high level of awareness for the project 
to run smoothly and be successful. 

We started with very ambitious development goals for AdminMax. Even though we did not meet all of our project goals, I believe 
that the final project was a success because we surpassed our specified base functionality, and more importantly, we learned a 
great deal about modern development practices and teamwork in the context of software engineering.
