### Introduction
AdminMax is a personnel management service. We have been a part of organizations and teams in the past that waste 
time on administrative tasks due to the use of fragmented and clunky services. Our project is intended to fill that 
void in the market and serve as a single, comprehensive personnel management service. There were no major changes to requirements, design, and development plans in our project's life cycle. We met most of our project goals on the front-end, but we fell short in our plans for backend development.
