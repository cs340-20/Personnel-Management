AdminMax: Status Report
Personnel-Management
Cainan Howard, Alex Whitaker, Sammy Awad, Timothy Krenz

INTRODUCTION

In the first half of the semester, the development of the core features of AdminMax has been steady and fruitful. The minimum viable version of the following features are complete: the homepage, methods to add, remove, and filter users, attendance and event management. The login solution and messaging feature are still in progress. Regarding changes, we moved toward a more user friendly and eye-pleasing interface. Other than the interface, we had no major changes to design or requirements. 

CUSTOMER VALUE

No changes

TECHNOLOGY

We are using a wide range of technology for AdminMan. To start, for our user login, we are using Google's login API which will provide a high-security, low-risk option for our users and our database. For the database itself, we are using phpmyadmin with MySQL. For all of the webpage, we're using custom, scratch code with HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP to integrate the database with the webservice. We will likely start hosting our webservice soon in order to implement the Google login API and a PHP Mailer library.

TEAM

THe roles of each team memeber stayed largely consistant with our project proposal, having each team memeber concentrate on a seperate tab of the application. Moving forward through the remaining iterations, our roles will change. Currently, the app is in a largely functional state as a minimum viable product. As such, our focus will turn to instating the remainder of the basic functionallity and adding supplemental functionality and conveniences. In these final iterations, the roles of each member will become less rigid as we work to implemnent extra functionality to the application. 


PROJECT MANAGEMENT

This project is making great progress. There is currently a running database for our example personnel members. There is also another database available for administrators to put in upcoming or previous events. Also there is a homepage with available option with who wants to log into what. As stated in the introduction section there is full implementation on removing and adding a person or event to a database. There has been good progess made on the theme of the website. With css we were able to make the pages look more appealling to viewer. The schedule for the upcoming weeks is to do some maintanance to the site. We do have some quirks we need to fix with the page. For example we do have some warnings that show up on our messaging and events pages. Also the website home page is not corresponding to the rest of the site. Once we up the performace of the website. We will look to implement personal logins and abilities for each type of security clearance. For example only admins reserve the right to add and remove items from the page database. 

REFLECTION

If we could have a fresh start on the project, we would likely benefit from using a library like bootstrap or css-grid properties to make the webpage design more flexible. The CSS hasn't been a major roadblock, but using an outside source could have eased our efforts and made the webpage more usable on all platforms. Overall, we've been able to accomplish many of the things that we intended to do and are continuing to make progress toward our desired functionality
