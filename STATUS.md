PROJECT MANAGEMENT

This project is making great progress. There is currently a running database for our example personnel members. There is also another database available for administrators to put in upcoming or previous events. Also there is a homepage with available option with who wants to log into what. As stated in the introduction section there is full implementation on removing and adding a person or event to a database. There has been good progess made on the theme of the website. With css we were able to make the pages look more appealling to viewer. The schedule for the upcoming weeks is to do some maintanance to the site. We do have some quirks we need to fix with the page. For example we do have some warnings that show up on our messaging and events pages. Also the website home page is not corresponding to the rest of the site. Once we up the performace of the website. We will look to implement personal logins and abilities for each type of security clearance. For example only admins reserve the right to add and remove items from the page database.
